BALL is a framework for structural biology and cheminformatics applications. BALL provides
data structures and algorithms to model and manipulate biological systems.\
BALL aims to implement Energy Evaluation, 
[Energy Minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_minimization#:~:text=In%20the%20field%20of%20computational,inter%2Datomic%20force%20on%20each),
[Molecular Dynamic Simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics#:~:text=Molecular%20dynamics%20(MD)%20is%20a,%22evolution%22%20of%20the%20system.),
[Docking](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/computational-chemistry/tutorials/cheminformatics/tutorial.html)
and [QSAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_structure%E2%80%93activity_relationship)
methods, among other functions.\

Julia Ball is based on [BALL in C++](https://ball-project.org/), developed and maintained by
groups at [University of Mainz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Mainz),
 [University of Saarland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saarland_University) and
[University of TÃ¼bingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_T%C3%BCbingen).\
 Julia BALL aims to be an end-user friendly and performant package, with many functionalities
 implemented and an extendible Interface.
